<p>
Are you an experienced musician, a novice guitarist, or just curious about developing your musical ear? Then this is the perfect app for you!

The app features a virtual guitar that you play just like you would play a real guitar. When you start the app, you can choose the difficulty level, which determines how challenging the guitar chords will be to figure out by ear.
